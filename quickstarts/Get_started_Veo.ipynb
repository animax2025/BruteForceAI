        "* **Unprecedented creative control**: Veo provides an unprecedented level of creative control, understanding prompts for all kinds of cinematic effects, like timelapses or aerial shots of a landscape.\n",
        "* **Videos with audio**: Veo 3 generates videos with audio automatically, with no additional effort from the developer.\n",
        "* **More accurate video controls**: Veo 3 is more accurate on lighting, accurate physics, and camera controls.\n",

Veo 3 Fast is ideal for backend services that programmatically generate ads, tools for rapid A/B testing of creative concepts, or apps that need to quickly produce social media content."
